## End to End IPL-Prediction-First-Score(Second-Innings)
Predictive Analysis of an IPL Match using 2008 to 2022 matches data 
to predicate result of every match. 24 hours before each game! We

algorithms analyze data including current team and player form, likely 
team line-ups, batting orders, pitch and weather conditions, and 
historical match statistics.
